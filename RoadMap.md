### Electroplating Station Mechanics
**Overview**
- The Electroplating Station is a new crafting station that requires electricity to function.
- It is essential for creating advanced alloys by combining various metals and materials

**Battery**
- Ingredients: Lithium, Iron / Zinc Ingots and Redstone
- Batteries must be charged with lightning from a Lightning Rod, which can be wired to the Electroplating Station where the Batteries are placed in

**Wire**
- Ingredients: Copper and Redstone
- Wire acts like Redstone, but transmits electrical currents from a Lightning Rod instead
